# LinearEquationSolver
Solving linear system of equations is common in many optimization problems. More particularly these arise often in force-directed placement algorithms where the objective is to minimize a quadratic function. This reduces to solving a large system of linear equations. Typically, even other non-quadratic optimization objectives for placement, such as the Half Perimeter Wire Length (HPWL) can be approximated by quadratic optimization goals by using the Bound2Bound (B2B) net model. Many different numerical techniques exist which solve such systems. 
Two commonly used algorithms are the Conjugate Gradient method and the SOR. Due to the large number of iterations required to solve the B2B objective, solving of the linear system may dominate the entire placement algorithm and thus it is highly imperative that the runtime of the linear solver be optimized. 
This project aims to implement and compare the effectiveness of existing techniques like the CG and SOR, in terms of its runtime.
